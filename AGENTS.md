# Pybar Project Rules

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/general.md), use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis. They're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed

## Development Guidelines

- Do NOT add/commit/push anything with git
- Do not edit files outside of the current repo without explicit permission

## Python Guidelines
- Code should be PEP8 compliant
- Lines should not exceed 79 characters
- Blank lines should contain no whitespace
